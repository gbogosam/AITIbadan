            <h1> Zamfara Politics: PDP Accuses APC of Plans To Arrest Chieftains.</h1>
            <p class="news-story">
                
                The Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has raised alarm over an alleged plan to arrest some of its chieftains, ahead of Saturday's National Assembly Supplementary Elections, in some parts of the state. <br><br>
                
                The PDP is accusing the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, of a clandestine plan to use the police to arrest them. <br><br>
                
                The Acting Chairman of the PDP, Mukhtar Lugga at a Press Conference in Gusau, the state capital, called on the Inspector General of Police, IGP Alkali Baba, to transfer the matter to the Zamfara State Police Command for the Commissioner of Police to handle, to avoid risking the lives of their chieftains having to ply the Gusau - Funtua Road to Abuja, which is unsafe. <br><br>
                
                He, however, warned state government officials to refrain from selling government properties to individuals without following due process, saying that the incoming administration will not tolerate such fraudulent activities. <br><br>
                
                The PDP State Acting Chairman seized the opportunity to thank the people of the state for coming out en mass to vote for their candidates in the March 18 Governorship and State Assembly Elections, even as he called on them to file out in large numbers for the supplementary election, coming on Saturday.br <br><br>
                
                It would be recalled that the National Assembly Elections were declared inconclusive at the Zamfara Central Senatorial District, Gusau/Tsafe Federal Constituency, and Gummi/ Bukkuyum Federal Constituency, which the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had rescheduled to the 15th of April.
