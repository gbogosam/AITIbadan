            <h1> Plateau Assembly Crisis; APC Demands Unsealing Of Complex as Speakership tussle Deepens</h1>
            <p class="news-story">
                The All Progressive Congress (APC) has appealed for immediate unsealing of Plateau State House of Assembly by the Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Bartholomew Onyeka for effective legislative function. <br><br>

                The Party while speaking to Newsmen in Jos, insisted that Yakubu Sanda remains the authentic and legitimate speaker of Plateau 9th Assembly. <br><br>
                
                On the 3rd April, 2023 Justice Nafisa Musa of the Plateau High Court reinstated Ayuba Abok as the legitimate speaker of the state Assembly, an order which was executed following a Plenary Presided Over by Abok, However, the commissioner of Police in the State following the escalation of the tussle ordered the Assembly complex be seal sighting
                threat to peace in the state. Since then, Major Political Parties  have took to the Media demanding for the Assembly complex be opened. <br><br>

                According to the APC, Abok, has ceased to be a Member of the House Because he never challenged the earlier declaration of his Seat as Vacant upon decamping to the PDP. <br><br>

                For over one week now, this State Assembly Complex has been under lock and key, whether the Complex will be open soon, that remains to seen, but one thing is certain, legislative Function here will continue hanging in the balance
