            <h1>LABOUR PARTY  HOLDS  PARALLEL GOVERNORSHIP PRIMARIES</h1>
            <p class="news-story">
                The Struggle for who becomes Labour Party governorship flag bearer in Imo state this  November, 2023 is characterized by crisis. <br>

                The party has held  parallel  governorship primaries at different  locations in Owerri the imo state capital.<br><br>

                The belief that Labour Party will become a strong contender in November 11 2023 election is taking another dimension. 

                As it stands, Labour Party in imo State has four governorship candidates from four different governorship primaries.<br><br>

                A member of the national Committee of the party Ibrahim  Alkali Mohammed was said to have conducted one of the primaries which produced Ikechukwu  Ukaegbu as candidate.

                Olufemi Abayomi, the national publicity Secretary of Arapaja  also produced Chibututu Isiguzo as governorship candidate.<br><br>

                The  faction which had Abia state Governor- elect, Alex Otti as the returning officer  also produced  Attah Achonu as candidate while another faction headed by Onyekwulisi Festus equally produced Basil Maduka as candidate.<br>
                With four candidates laying claims to the governorship ticket, it is clear that the judiciary will be the final arbiter.
